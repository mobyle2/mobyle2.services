            comment: "The normal behaviour of 'compseq' is to count the frequencies\
                \ of all words that occur by moving a window of length  'word' up\
                \ by one each time. \n  This option allows you to move the window\
                \ up by the length of the  word each time, skipping over the intervening\
                \ words. \n  You can count only those words that occur in a single\
                \ frame of the  word by setting this value to a number other than\
                \ zero. \n  If you set it to 1 it will only count the words in frame\
                \ 1, 2 will  only count the words in frame 2 and so on."

                \ calculated from the observed frequency of single bases or  residues\
                \ in the sequences. \n  If you are reporting a word size of 1 (single\
                \ bases or residues)  then there is no point in using this option\
                \ because the calculated  expected frequency will be equal to the\
                \ observed frequency. \n  Calculating the expected frequencies like\
                \ this will give an  approximation of the expected frequencies that\
                \ you might get by  using an input file of frequencies produced by\
                \ a previous run of  this program. If an input file of expected word\
                \ frequencies has  been specified then the values from that file will\
