            comment: This parameter loosens the search parameters for EufindtRNA to
                improve detection of prokaryotic tRNAs. Use this option when scanning
                prokaryotic sequences or both eukaryotic and prokaryotic sequences
                in the same sequence file. This option also disables pseudogene checking
                automatically since criteria for pseudogene checking were developed
                for eukaryotic pseudogenes.Use of this mode with prokaryotic sequences
                will also improve bounds prediction of the 3' end (the terminal CCA
                triplet).

            comment: This parameter bypasses the fast first-pass scanners that are
                poor at detecting organellar tRNAs and runs Cove analysis only. Since
                true organellar tRNAs have been found to have Cove scores between
                15 and 20 bits, the search cutoff is lowered from 20 to 15 bits. Also,
                pseudogene checking is disabled since it is only applicable to eukaryotic
                cytoplasmic tRNA pseudogenes. Since Cove-only mode is used, searches
                will be very slow (see -C option below) relative to the default mode.

            comment: This option selects the general tRNA covariance model that was
                trained on tRNAs from all three phylogenetic domains (archaea, bacteria,
                & eukarya). This mode can be used when analyzing a mixed collection
                of sequences from more than one phylogenetic domain, with only slight
                loss of sensitivity and selectivity.The original publication describing
                this program and tRNAscan-SE version 1.0 used this general tRNA model
                exclusively.  If you wish to compare scores to those found in the
                paper or scans using v1.0, use this option.  Use of this option is
                compatible with all other search mode options described in this section.

                only. This option allows a slightly more sensitive search than the
                default tRNAscan + EufindtRNA -> Cove mode, but is much slower (by
                approx. 250 to 3,000 fold). Output format and other program defaults
                are otherwise identical to the normal analysis.

            comment: Since tRNA pseudogenes often have one very low component (good
                secondary structure but poor primary sequence similarity to the tRNA
                model, or vice versa), this information may be useful in deciding
                whether a low-scoring tRNA is likely to be a pseudogene.  The heuristic
                pseudogene detection filter uses this information to flag possible
                pseudogenes -- use this option to see why a hit is marked as a possible
                pseudogene.  The user may wish to examine score breakdowns from known
                tRNAs in the organism of interest to get a frame of reference.

            comment: Directs tRNAscan-SE to use only tRNAscan to analyze sequences.
                This mode will default to using 'strict' parameters with tRNAscan
                analysis (similar to tRNAscan version 1.3 operation). This mode of
                operation is faster (3-5 times faster than default mode analysis),
                but will result in approximately 0.2 to 0.6 false positive tRNAs per
                Mbp, decreased sensitivity, and less reliable prediction of anticodons,
                tRNA isotype, and introns.

            comment: Since Cove is not being used as a secondary filter to remove
                false positives, this run mode defaults to 'Normal' parameters which
                more closely approximates the sensitivity and selectivity of the original
                algorithm describe by Pavesi and colleagues (see the option -e for
                a description of the various run modes).

            comment: Explicitly set EufindtRNA params, where <mode>= R, N, or S (relaxed,
                normal, or strict). The 'relaxed' mode is used for EufindtRNA when
                using tRNAscan-SE in default mode. With relaxed parameters, tRNAs
                that lack pol III poly-T terminators are not penalized, increasing
                search sensitivity, but decreasing selectivity. When Cove analysis
                is being used as a secondary filter for false positives (as in tRNAscan-SE's
                default mode), overall selectivity is not decreased.Using 'normal'
                parameters with EufindtRNA does incorporate a log odds score for the
                distance between the B box and the first poly-T terminator, but does
                not disqualify tRNAs that do not have a terminator signal within 60
                nucleotides. This mode is used by default when Cove analysis is not
                being used as a secondary false positive filter.Using 'strict' parameters
                with EufindtRNA also incorporates a log odds score for the distance
                between the B box and the first poly-T terminator, but _rejects_ tRNAs
                that do not have such a signal within 60 nucleotides of the end of
                the B box. This mode most closely approximates the originally published
                search algorithm (3); sensitivity is reduced relative to using 'relaxed'
                and 'normal' modes, but selectivity is increased which is important
                if no secondary filter, such as Cove analysis, is being used to remove
                false positives. This mode will miss most prokaryotic tRNAs since
                the poly-T terminator signal is a feature specific to eukaryotic tRNAs
                genes (always use 'relaxed' mode for scanning prokaryotic sequences
                for tRNAs).

                either secondary structure output (-f option) or ACeDB output (-a
                option) without having to re-scan entire sequences. Alternatively,
                if the -r option is used to generate the previous results file, tRNAscan-SE
                will pick up at the stage of Cove-confirmation of tRNAs and output
                final tRNA predictons as with a normal run.

            comment: This option allows the user to specify a different Cove score
                threshold for reporting tRNAs. It is not recommended that novice users
                change this cutoff, as a lower cutoff score will increase the number
                of pseudogenes and other false positives found by tRNAscan-SE (especially
                when used with the 'Cove only' scan mode). Conversely, a higher cutoff
                than 20.0 bits will likely cause true tRNAs to be missed by tRNAscan
                (numerous 'real' tRNAs have been found just above the 20.0 cutoff).
                Knowledgable users may wish to experiment with this parameter to find
                very unusual tRNAs or pseudogenes beyond the normal range of detection
                with the preceding caveats in mind.

            comment: 'Set max length of tRNA intron+variable region (default=116bp).
                The default maximum tRNA length for tRNAscan-SE is 192 bp, but this
                limit can be increased with this option to allow searches with no
                practical limit on tRNA length. In the first phase of tRNAscan-SE,
                EufindtRNA searches for A and B boxes of <length> maximum distance
                apart, and passes only the 5'' and 3'' tRNA ends to covariance model
                analysis for confirmation (removing the bulk of long intervening sequences).
                tRNAs containing group I and II introns have been detected by setting
                this parameter to over 800 bp. Caution: group I or II introns in tRNAs
                tend to occur in positions other than the canonical position of protein-spliced
                introns, so tRNAscan-SE mispredicts the intron bounds and anticodon
                sequence for these cases. tRNA bound predictions, however, have been

            comment: Save final results and Cove tRNA secondary structure predictions.
                This output format makes visual inspection of individual tRNA predictions
                easier since the tRNA sequence is displayed along with the predicted
                tRNA base pairings.

comment: 'tRNAscan-SE identifies transfer RNA genes in genomic DNA or RNA sequences.  It
    combines the specificity of the Cove probabilistic RNA prediction package (Eddy
    & Durbin, 1994) with the speed and sensitivity of tRNAscan 1.3 (Fichant & Burks,
    1991) plus an implementation of an algorithm described by Pavesi and colleagues

    (1994) which searches for eukaryotic pol III tRNA promoters (our implementation
    referred to as EufindtRNA).  tRNAscan and EufindtRNA are used as first-pass prefilters
    to identify "candidate" tRNA regions of the sequence.  These subsequences are
    then passed to Cove for further analysis, and output if Cove confirms the initial
    tRNA prediction.'
