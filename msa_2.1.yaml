            comment: Turns  off  the optimal multiple alignment segment of the program.This
                allows the user to see the heuristic alignment and other data produced
                by the program before the it attempts to produce an optimal multiple
                alignment.

            comment: The cost of a multiple alignment is taken to be the unweighted
                sum of all the pairwise alignments.  In the absence of this flag,
                the program estimates an evolutionary tree and uses it to  assign
                weights  to  each  pairwise  alignment using either rationale-1 or
                rational-2 as described in Altschul et al., J.  Molec.  Biol.  208
                (1989).
