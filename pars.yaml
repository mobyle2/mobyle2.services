            comment: "PARS is a general parsimony program which carries out the Wagner\
                \ parsimony method with multiple states. Wagner parsimony allows changes\
                \ among all states. The criterion is to find the tree which requires\
                \ the minimum number of changes. The Wagner method was originated\
                \ by Eck and Dayhoff (1966) and by Kluge and Farris (1969). Here are\
                \ its assumptions:1. Ancestral states are unknown.2. Different characters\
                \ evolve independently.3. Different lineages evolve independently.4.\
                \ Changes to all other states are equally probable (Wagner).5. These\
                \ changes are a priori improbable over the evolutionary time spans\
                \ involved in the differentiation of the group in question.6. Other\
                \ kinds of evolutionary event such as retention of polymorphism are\
                \ far less probable than these state changes.7. Rates of evolution\
                \ in different lineages are sufficiently low that two changes in a\
                \ long segment of the tree are far less probable than one change in\
                \ a short segment.PARS can handle both bifurcating and multifurcating\
                \ trees. In doing its search for most parsimonious trees, it adds\
                \ species not only by creating new forks in the middle of existing\
                \ branches, but it also tries putting them at the end of new branches\
                \ which are added to existing forks. Thus it searches among both bifurcating\
                \ and multifurcating trees. If a branch in a tree does not have any\
                \ characters which might change in that branch in the most parsimonious\
                \ tree, it does not save\n              that tree. Thus in any tree\
                \ that results, a branch exists only if some character has a most\
                \ parsimonious reconstruction that would involve change in that branch."

            comment: "The resampling methods available are:The bootstrap.Bootstrapping\
                \ was invented by Bradley Efron in 1979, and its use in phylogeny\
                \ estimation was introduced by me (Felsenstein, 1985b; see also Penny\
                \ and Hendy, 1985). \n          It involves creating a new data set\
                \ by sampling N characters randomly with replacement, so that the\
                \ resulting data set has the same size as the original,\n        \
                \  but some characters have been left out and others are duplicated.\
                \ The random variation of the results from analyzing these bootstrapped\
                \ data sets can be\n          shown statistically to be typical of\
                \ the variation that you would get from collecting new data sets.\n\
                \          The method assumes that the characters evolve independently,\
                \ an assumption that may not be realistic for many kinds of data.Delete-half-jackknifing.This\
                \ alternative to the bootstrap involves sampling a random half of\
                \ the characters, and including them in the data but dropping the\
                \ others.\n           The resulting data sets are half the size of\
                \ the original, and no characters are duplicated.\n           The\
                \ random variation from doing this should be very similar to that\
                \ obtained from the bootstrap. \n           The method is advocated\
                \ by Wu (1986). It was mentioned by me in my bootstrapping paper (Felsenstein,\
                \ 1985b), and has been available\n           for many years in this\
                \ program as an option. \n           Note that, for the present, block-jackknifing\
                \ is not available, because I cannot figure out how to do it straightforwardly\
                \ when the block size is not a divisor of the number of characters.Permuting\
                \ species within characters.This method of resampling (well, OK, it\
                \ may not be best to call it resampling) was introduced by Archie\
                \ (1989) and Faith (1990; see also Faith and Cranston, 1991).\n  \
                \        It involves permuting the columns of the data matrix separately.\n\
                \          This produces data matrices that have the same number and\
                \ kinds of characters but no taxonomic structure.\n          It is\
                \ used for different purposes than the bootstrap, as it tests not\
                \ the variation around an estimated tree but the\n          hypothesis\
                \ that there is no taxonomic structure in the data: if a statistic\
                \ such as number of steps is significantly smaller in the actual data\
                \ than it is in replicates that are permuted, \n          then we\
                \ can argue that there is some taxonomic structure in the data (though\
                \ perhaps it might be just the presence of aa pair of sibling species).Permuting\
                \ characters.This simply permutes the order of the characters, the\
                \ same reordering being applied to all species.\n          For many\
                \ methods of tree inference this will make no difference to the outcome\
                \ (unless one has rates of evolution correlated among adjacent sites).\n\
                \          It is included as a possible step in carrying out a permutation\
                \ test of homogeneity of characters (such as the Incongruence Length\
                \ Difference test).Permuting characters separately for each species.This\
                \ is a method introduced by Steel, Lockhart, and Penny (1993) to permute\
                \ data so as to destroy all phylogenetic structure, while keeping\
                \ the base composition of each species the same as before.\n     \
                \     It shuffles the character order separately for each species.Jumblethe\
                \ tree construction programs the exact details of the search of different\
                \ trees depend on the order of input of species. \n          In these\
                \ programs J option enables you to tell the program to use a random\

                in the middle of the branch which is connected to this species, with
                Mouse branching off on one side of the root and the lineage leading
                to the rest of the tree on the other.This option is toggle on by choosing
                the number of the outgroup (the species being taken in the numerical
                order that they occur in the input file).Outgroup-rooting will not
                be attempted  if it is a user-defined tree, despite your invoking
                the option.When it is used, the tree as printed out is still listed
                as being an unrooted tree, though the outgroup is connected to the
                bottommost node so that it is easy to visually convert the tree into

comment: PARS is a general parsimony program which carries out the Wagner parsimony
    method with multiple states. Wagner parsimony allows changes among all states.
    The criterion is to find the tree which requires the minimum number of changes.
