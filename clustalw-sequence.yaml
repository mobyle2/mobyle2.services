        comment: By PROFILE ALIGNMENT, we mean alignment using existing alignments.
            Profile alignments allow you to store alignments of your favorite sequences
            and add new sequences to them in small bunches at a time. (e.g. an alignment
            output file from CLUSTAL W). One or both sets of input sequences may include
            secondary structure assignments or gap penalty masks to guide the alignment.Merge

            They are used to give initial alignments which are then rescored to give
            percent identity scores. These % scores are the ones which are displayed
            on the screen. The scores are converted to distances for the trees.

        comment: These options, when doing a profile alignment, allow you to set 2D
            structure parameters. If a solved structure is available, it can be used
            to guide the alignment by raising gap penalties within secondary structure
            elements, so that gaps will preferentially be inserted into unstructured
            surface loops. Alternatively, a user-specified gap penalty mask can be
            supplied directly.A gap penalty mask is a series of numbers between 1
            and 9, one per position in the alignment. Each number specifies how much
            the gap opening penalty is to be raised at that position (raised by multiplying
            the basic gap opening penalty by the number) i.e. a mask figure of 1 at
            a position means no change in gap opening penalty; a figure of 4 means
            that the gap opening penalty is four times greater at that position, making
            gaps 4 times harder to open.Gap penalty masks is to be supplied with the
            input sequences. The masks work by raising gap penalties in specified
            regions (typically secondary structure elements) so that gaps are preferentially
            opened in the less well conserved regions (typically surface loops).CLUSTAL
            W can read the masks from SWISS-PROT, CLUSTAL or GDE format input files.
            For many 3-D protein structures, secondary structure information is recorded
            in the feature tables of SWISS-PROT database entries. You should always
            check that the assignments are correct - some are quite inaccurate. CLUSTAL
            W looks for SWISS-PROT HELIX and STRAND assignments e.g.FT HELIX 100 115FT
            HELIX 100 115The structure and penalty masks can also be read from CLUSTAL
            alignment format as comment lines beginning !SS_ or GM_ e.g.!SS_HBA_HUMA
            ..aaaAAAAAAAAAAaaa.aaaAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaAaaa.........aaaAAAAAA!GM_HBA_HUMA
            112224444444444222122244444444442222224222111111111222444444HBA_HUMA VLSPADKTNVKAAWGKVGAHAGEYGAEALERMFLSFPTTKTYFPHFDLSHGSAQVKGHGKNote
            that the mask itself is a set of numbers between 1 and 9 each of which
            is assigned to the residue(s) in the same column below. In GDE flat file
            format, the masks are specified as text and the names must begin with
            SS_ or GM_. Either a structure or penalty mask or both may be used. If
            both are included in an alignment, the user will be asked which is to
            be used.

            comment: This option (together with the -strandendout option) specify
                the range of structure termini for the intermediate penalties. In
                the alignment output, these are indicated as lower case. For Beta
                Strands, the default range spans the end residue and the adjacent
                loop residue, since sequence conservation often extends beyond the
                actual H-bonded Beta Strand.

            comment: This option lets you choose whether or not to include the masks
                in the CLUSTAL W output alignments. Showing both is useful for understanding
                how the masks work. The secondary structure information is itself
                very useful in judging the alignment quality and in seeing how residue
                conservation patterns vary with secondary structure.
